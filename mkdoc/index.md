IEC 60870-5 part 104 enables communication between IED, RTU control station and substation via a standard TCP/IP network. 
The TCP protocol is used for connection-oriented secure data transmission.
IEC 60870 5104 protocol (IEC 104) is a part of IEC Telecontrol Equipment and Systems Standard IEC 60870-5 that provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems in electrical engineering and power system automation.
IEC 60870 part 5 is one of the IEC 60870 set of standards which define systems used for telecontrol (supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA) in electrical engineering and power system automation applications. 
Part 5 provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The IEC Technical Committee 57 (Working Group 03) have developed a protocol standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for electric power systems. 
The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:

- IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
- IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
- IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
- IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
- IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions
