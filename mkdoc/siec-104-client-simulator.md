# [IEC 60870-5-104 Protocol Client Master Simulator](http://www.freyrscada.com/iec-60870-5-104-Client-Simulator.php)


Complete Simulation of IEC 104 Client as per Protocol Standard including File transfer (Both Monitoring and control direction).

[![IEC 60870-5 part 104 Protocol Client Master Simulator](https://github.com/FreyrSCADA/IEC-60870-5-104/raw/master/img/iec104-client-sim.jpg)](http://www.freyrscada.com/iec-60870-5-104-Client-Simulator.php)


â€‹Support all type of ASDU Typeid according to protocol specification

1) Monitoring (Process information in monitor direction), M_SP. M_DP, M_ST,...

2) control (Process information in control direction), C_SC, C_DC, ...

3)  System information in monitor direction, M_EI

4) System information in control direction C_IC, C_CI

5)  Parameter in control direction, P_ME

6) File transfer ( Both Monitor And Control Direction) F_FR, F_SR, F_SC



IEC104 Client Simulator was originally developed to test the functionalities of IEC 60870-5-104 stack Client operation.

We can add up to 50 Client node in the simulator. Every Client node will work independently.

Simulator window shows the Connection status, connection ip address and port number.
